## Description

Smooth Ball 2 is a totally free game and very simple, but only in appearance. It is easy to play but it will take you some games to dominate its original control.

We all know that it is a drag spining around the mobile phone, so...Smooth Ball 2 has a vertical scroll that will impede your boss knowing if you are playing or simply reading a job email!

The game consists in avoid the platforms that fall with only one tap control. Press to separate the ball in two (the more time you press the more far they separate) and drop to let them join again. The game is boundless*, but the speed increases while we beat the platforms. Until where are you going to reach?
